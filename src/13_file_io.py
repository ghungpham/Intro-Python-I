Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file

# YOUR CODE HERE
file = open("foo.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()


# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make 
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
file = open("bar.txt", "w")
file.write("Wow, one line\n")
file.write("Wow, another line\n")
file.write("Wow, more line\n")
file.close()
